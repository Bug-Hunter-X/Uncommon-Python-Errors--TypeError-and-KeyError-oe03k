# Uncommon Python Errors

This repository demonstrates a couple of uncommon errors that can occur in Python and how to handle them.  Specifically, it shows how to deal with `TypeError` that can occur when performing an operation on an unexpected data type and `KeyError` from accessing a dictionary key that does not exist.  The solution file provides fixes and best practices to avoid these issues.

## Errors Covered:

* **`TypeError`**:  Caused when trying mathematical operations on incompatible types. 
* **`KeyError`**: Happens when attempting to access a key that doesn't exist within a dictionary.

## How to Use:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `bug.py` file to see the errors. 
3. Compare with the fixes in `bugSolution.py` to improve your code's robustness.
